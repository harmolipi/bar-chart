# D3 Bar Chart

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/d3-bar-chart).

## Functionality

This is the [Bar Chart](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart) project, where I pull data from an API and visualize it in a bar chart with the D3 library.

## Thoughts

This was somehow both very different than everything I've done so far, and also surprisingly similar.

On the one hand, the bulk of this entailed using D3's methods to handle the data, which was new to me. It was a bit confusing at first, but gradually made sense. D3 offers very granular control over visualizations, and essentially gives you the ability to make rather basic HTML and CSS changes based on the body of data, which leads to the familiar part.

D3 really didn't feel like using a totally foreign tool, as would maybe SQL or doing similar things with a spreadsheet program. D3 just gives me the ability to use data to modify HTML and CSS in ways that I've already been doing all along - setting the size, color, and positions of elements. The one downside of this is that it took me a bit more time to make a bar chart in this project than it would've with something like Google Sheets, but on the other hand, I have control over every little piece of it, and can make whatever customizations I need to. Cool stuff.

God bless.
